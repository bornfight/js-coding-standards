Procedure for adding new rules to the repository after code reviewing:
1.  Check if the error is recurring or critical (important for everybody)
2.  Create a pull request
    1.  Write a rule to correct the mistake
    2.  Write a short code snippet (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)
        1.  Keep it generic
        2.  Minimal code possible
        2.  Avoid copy/pasting from private projects
3.  Create a pull request
4.  If the rule can be automated, write a rule for ESlint
