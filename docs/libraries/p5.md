## Positive
- Works great with Chrome and Firefox.
- Simple interface

## Negative
- Audio doesn't work with Safari (it uses WebRTC for audio conversion)
    - Safari is not compliant with WebRTC standard at this moment
- Complicated extraction of saveable format
    - had to extract library code outside of it to get base64 encoded sound
